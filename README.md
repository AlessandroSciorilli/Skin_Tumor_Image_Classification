### Machine Learning Model for Skin Tumor Image Classification, 2023
- Developed a machine learning model to classify skin tumors using dermatoscopic images, enhancing early diagnosis and treatment strategies.
- Implemented image processing techniques such as local binary pattern analysis, grayscale conversion, and edge detection using Prewitt operators, alongside image resizing for consistent analysis.
- Balanced the dataset by resizing and ensuring equal representation of different tumor types, leading to more accurate and unbiased classification results.
- Utilized a variety of machine learning algorithms for accurate tumor classification, achieving exceptional results with the Random Forest Classifier, characterized by high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its robustness in identifying different tumor types.
- Deployed the model on PythonAnywhere with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions
